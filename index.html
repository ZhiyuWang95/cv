            Our team is responsible for development and testing of a cellular network system based on linux. <br>
            Besides, I like web development and doing some full stack projects in my spare time.
            I can work as many roles in a team. Being part of a team gives me more achievablity
            when check our goal, I can also learn faster from teammates. <br>
            I love structure and also stand for readability and maintainability. Like the saying, <br>
            "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code
            that humans can understand." <br> --- Martin Fowler.
